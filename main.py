find some way to fix rendering, it looks weird, on one side only though

"""
the plan
first:
    hooray! the rendering and scaling work fine
    but now i need perlin noise generation to happen
    
    infinite world or finite, pre-generated? maybe add option for both
    save player/world files into txt or something
    block types:
        air, grass, dirt, stone, snow, sand, water, ice, logs, planks, glass

animation ideas:
    make an animation system that works for holding things easily
    DONT MAKE THE ANIMATIONS SUPER COMPLEX - simple works good

    anchor the player's arms to shoulders, and rotate them around that
    maybe use IK or something similar i could come up with
        get distance to where hands should be, compare that to the arm's lengths,
        figure rest out later
    or i could make a few generalized animations, swing two handed, swing one handed
    held one handed, held two handed
    later edit: why would i want to use inverse kinematics here??

    customizable sections of player (color, armor, etc)
        color of skin, armor, clothes
        save different colorable things as separate surfaces so they can be recolored]1

lighting system ideas:
    use something similar to minecraft's lighting, light emmitting stuff has a light level,
    light decays over distance, more so through walls, daytime has a high light level
    use pygame coloring stuff to change block's lighting

crafting system:
    copy minecraft?
